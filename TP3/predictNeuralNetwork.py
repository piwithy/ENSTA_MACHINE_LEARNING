# ====================== YOUR CODE HERE ======================
# Instructions: Complete the following code to make predictions using
#               your learned neural network. You should set p to a 
#               vector containing labels between 1 to num_labels.
#
# Hint: The max function might come in useful. In particular, the np.argmax
#       function can return the index of the max element, for more
#       information see 'numpy.argmax' on the numpy website. If your examples 
#       are in rows, then, you can use np.argmax(probs, axis=1) to obtain the 
#       max for each row.
